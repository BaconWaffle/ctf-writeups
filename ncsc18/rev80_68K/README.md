# Rev80 68K

The assembly was for Motorola 68000. After running it in a simulator, testing various inputs and outputs, we wrote this equivalent script to basically verify a guessed input. Since all operations were done on a byte-per-byte basis, it was easy enoug to guess until we got the right answer (it prints every mistake you have, change things until it is silent and you have the flag).
